## Greetings

I'm Nullwander, but for the sake of ease, call me Jake. I'm aspiring to join the ranks of Cybersecurity Analysts â€” hopefully leading into either DFIR or Red Teaming. I've been interested in computers since I first laid hands on one, passively gaining knowledge over the years. Recently, I decided to make the full leap into IT.

This Git repo is here to document my cybersecurity learning journey: TryHackMe rooms, PicoCTF events, self-written scripts, and more as I continue to sharpen my skill set.

## Ongoings

I recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. I see it as a *stepping stone*, which is exactly how it should be used. I'm currently studying for the A+ exam, then moving on to Network+, and later Security+.

While studying, I'm also:
- Writing scripts when inspiration hits
- Researching topics like LOTL techniques and how APTs operate
- Following real-world cases, including insider trading via compromised news, banks, and supply chain abuse (like the EggPLC case in the 2010s)

## About Me

I've been gaming my whole life â€” Minecraft, CS:GO, StarCraft II, League of Legends, you name it. My first game at age four was *MX: Unleashed*. I never beat it.

At 13, Minecraft opened the door to a whole new world: SQLi, cheatware malware, keyloggers, account theft, Bitcoin theft, botnets... you get the picture.

Outside of tech, I lived a pretty normal life. Passed AP Computer Science, drifted through school, and eventually landed in Canada through immigration â€” now living with the one I love and working on launching a new career in cybersecurity.

## Final Notes

Thank you for reading this page. I donâ€™t usually share my story, but I want this repo to be more than a resume.

So again â€” thank you.  
And if I donâ€™t see you again:  
**Have a good afternoon, a good evening, and a good night.** ðŸ™‚
