Hello, friend. 

This github repository's sole purpose is to document my journey learning
cybersecurity. I have always been interested in it, ever since I was young - about 13 years old.
I've gone through the journey of life up to this point. Met script kiddies on the internet.
I learned from others during my time online. Botnets, SSH keygens, passwords and input sanitizations. Most of it theorycrafting, not hands-on. 
Today, and from now on, I'm changing that. 

Goodbye, friend. :)
