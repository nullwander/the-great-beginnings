Hello, friend. 

This github repository's sole purpose is to document my journey learning
cybersecurity. I have always been interested in it, ever since I was young - about 13 years old.
I've gone through the journey of life up to this point. Met script kiddies on the internet.
I learned from others during my time online. Botnets, SSH keygens, passwords and input sanitizations. Most of it theorycrafting, not hands-on. Nowadays, I also double check my syntaxing and work using AI. The logic, base code, and everything else is still mine.
