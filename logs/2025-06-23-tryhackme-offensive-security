Topic: Tryhackme's Offensive Security room. 

Description: It uses gobuster to check a fake bank webpage for any endpoints left open, such as admin, robots, or in this case bank-transfer. 

It uses a wordlist along with gobuster, just like you would with John the Ripper
or any other type of guessing/cracking tool. Always recommended to use multiple
lists. 

Tools Used:
- Gobuster
- Tryhackme lab/terminal

Lessons learned: 
- How to search for additional locations on a webpage using wordlists and gobuster. 
- The importance of making sure everything that should not be accessed is locked down. 
- The importance of mapping and tracking your website's ports, endpoints, and information.

Notes for future me: Make sure you use multiple lists. Don't get lazy.

Goodbye, friend.
