## Week of 06/30/2025 
This week, I've been doing a bit more in the way of deep dives and research than actual hands-on scripting and tool making. I've been focusing on studying for my A+, and doing the fun research for a bit. 

## Things I'm learning:
- **Re-established knowledge on Displays, Mobile Connections, and basic Networking via Professer Messer's videos, while taking comprehensive notes.**
- **Made the switch to start learning Powershell scripts - made my first script this morning (Diagnostic_Scripts folder). I used AI to debug and to steer me in the correct general direction, but other than that it's all me. I never took actual code from it.**
- **Worked on Legacy Hardware doing data recovery for my family. I successfully restored an old Acer desktop using Pentium cores, and an old Dell Desktop with the same. The Acer ran windows 7, and the Dell ran Vista. The Dell had virtual mounts, and used a USB-Locked Briefcase, which I thought seemed advanced for users at that time.**
- **Ethics research and learning pathways. I understand that doing things like "Cert Hunting" is not the best way to gain any sort of merit other than the cert itself. They're stepping stones, not proof of hands-on skill.**

## Tools I used:
- **ChatGPT for debugging and augmenting my learning. I try to not let it give me answers unless its for comprehension on a subject that I'm new to. All code it does provide, whether as an example or if it decided to just print an entire block, I read through it and break down parts I don't understand. I use man pages and forums. If it doesn't click, only then do I go back.**
- **VS Code for a basic coding environment. I have only the base add-ons for bash and powershell.**
- **Linux CLI/Powershell/CMD. Using the three of these more often is leading to me having a better understanding of all three. I'm currently the most comfortable with Linux's CLI.**
- **Bleeping Computer and other news sites for keeping up-to-date on the latest cybersecurity news.**

## What's next:
Later this today, I'm going to be doing Tryhackme rooms (07/02/2025). I'll use them as an introduction to things like SOC work, and to reinforce my knowledge on Networking fundamentals. Repitition and failure is key to learning. 
I'll also be doing **practice tests and flash cards** to help me get the knowledge down even more. 
In the next few months, I'm hoping to take both 1101 and 1102 -  as long as I'm comfortable with the material first. Anything I don't fully understand, I'll need to go back and re-learn until I do. 

## Final Notes: 
So far I've been learning that my experience in my life up to this point has been acting as a "boost" if you would. My knowledge of malpractice from users in the gaming community has increased my interest and knowledge of the scene without me even realizing it. It's propelled me to learn as fast as I do now, and makes me want to keep going.
